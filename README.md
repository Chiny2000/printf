PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.       Write a function that produces output according to a format.
A function that produces output according to a specified format is a powerful tool often found in programming languages. This function allows developers to format and display data in a specific manner, catering to various requirements.

2.       Handle following conversion specifiers
Handling conversion specifiers in programming involves formatting and processing different types of data according to specific rules. In the context of functions like printf, conversion specifiers are placeholders within a format string that dictate how different types of data should be displayed. Here are some short notes on handling common conversion specifier

3.       Using a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize the number of calls to the write function is a common optimization technique in programming, especially when dealing with output operations.
